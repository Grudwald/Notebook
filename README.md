### If you can't run the application, you probably don't have Node, NPM and VUE CLI installed on your computer. If you want to get things working, install them. This is how you can do it on Linux Ubuntu/Mint:

<br>

First, update the local package index:
```
sudo apt update
```

Install the Node js repository:
```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Then install the npm package manager:
```
sudo apt install npm
```

And of course install the Vue CLI:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

<br><br>


It's done! You can run it! To start, open the root folder of the project in the console and run the project with the command below:
```
npm run serve
```
